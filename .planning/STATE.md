## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.1 Research]: Content storage as String @db.Text (JSON-stringified Tiptap doc), not JSONB
- [v1.1 Research]: Tiptap v3 (3.20.x) for rich text editing, loaded via dynamic({ ssr: false })
- [v1.1 Research]: isomorphic-dompurify with jsdom pinned to 25.0.1 for XSS sanitization
- [v1.1 Research]: Reader view built BEFORE editor to validate backend filtering end-to-end
- [v1.1 Research]: MANAGE_GUIDE as single new permission; GuidesModule follows existing module pattern
- [Phase 14]: Used prisma migrate resolve for migration drift recovery instead of prisma migrate dev
- [Phase 14]: PresignGuideDto restricts contentType to image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp only
- [Phase 14]: DOMPurify default import works in NestJS with esModuleInterop: true
- [Phase 14]: 404 returned for inaccessible guide pages instead of 403 to prevent information disclosure
- [Phase 14]: Prisma has operator used for role_codes array membership filtering
- [Phase 15]: DynamicIcon extracted to shared component for Lucide icon name resolution across guide pages
- [Phase 15]: Guide section detail page reuses same TanStack Query cache key as index page for instant navigation
- [Phase 15]: GuideProseRenderer dynamically imported with ssr:false to prevent Tiptap SSR crash
- [Phase 15]: Two-query data fetching: shared sections cache + page-by-ID to avoid slug-based endpoint pitfall
- [Phase 15]: DOMPurify sanitizes generateHTML output before Tiptap editor content as defense-in-depth

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 18 added: Data Export — CSV/XLSX export for 22 report types
- Phase 19 added: Master Data Import — ingredients, vendors, vendor pricing
- Phase 20 added: Operations Import — stock, recipes, menu, events, tasks, quests, KPIs
